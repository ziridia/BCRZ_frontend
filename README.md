### Testing

All tests can be found in `/testing/tests`. Test reports can be found in `/testing/reports`. New reports can be automatically generated by running `bash run_all_tests.sh` in `/testing`. A log of all test fixes that were made can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qMd1ZbFGjR945tabR7wGr-Sy7MVfzsITrMDxfJ6-ucw/edit?tab=t.0)

It is also worth noting that the automated testing requires python to be added to path. The program does not need to be compiled to an executable binary before testing.

#### Reports

Reports follow the general form of
<br>
```
Path | pass/fail | actual output | expected output | input
```
<br>
if a test passes, only the first two columns will be filled. If a test and program output differ, the test is considered failed, and every line that differs will be reported as a fail.
