recursively go through all directories in the testing/tests directory.

Once a directory with `input.txt`, `output.txt`, and `transaction_log.txt` are found, the script should

 - run the testing script with `input.txt` as the input and save the program output to `output.test`
   * the transaction log should also be saved to `transaction_log.test`

 - run the comparison script, which will save any failures to the test report document (more details below)

 - repeat the last two steps until all directories have been traversed


testing script details:
    the program should be run, and the program inputs stored in `input.txt` should be fed into the program

    all program command line outputs should be saved to `output.test`

    the script should specify the save path for the transaction log to be the same directory as the test, with a file name of `transaction_log.test`


comparison script details:

    This will compare the `output.txt` file and the `output.test` file in each directory.

    any lines that do not match will be saved as a list in memory

    if there are any mismatched lines, the test will be flagged as failed

    after the comparison of all lines has been completed, all output should be appended to a report file


report file details:

    Expected format:
        Path            pass/fail   input       actual output       expected output
        create/Create1  pass
        create/Create2  fail        john doe    user not found      enter account number
                                    00001       unknown command     enter balance
                                    99999.99    unknown command     account created

    I expect getting this to be formatted properly will not be realistic, so having proper tab spacing is less important.
    stating the path every time too, and pass/fail is also acceptable.

    if a test passes all line comparisons, the report should just state that the test passed and leave it at that

    if a test fails anywhere, it should state that the test as a whole failed, and print all lines that mismatched
    any lines that match should not be saved to the report file


pseudocode:

for all directories and subdirectories:

    if directory does not contain `input.txt`, `output.txt`, and `transaction_log.txt`:
        continue
    
    // feed the script the input file, and the output directory to save the program output and log file to
    test_program(input.txt, output_directory)

    // compare the test output to the actual output
    compare(output.test, output.txt, path_to_report_file)

    compare(transaction_log.test, transaction_log.txt, path_to_report_file)
